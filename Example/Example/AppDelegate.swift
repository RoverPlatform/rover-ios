These custom URL schemes are commonly referred to as "deep links". The `rover-example-app` scheme used below is set in Example/Example/Info.plist as a URL Scheme. Your app will likely have its own bespoke routing system for handling "deep links". For the purposes of demonstration, a simple boilerplate example follows. See the documentation for greater details.
