// I will have to use classes instead of structs for one big reason  With classes, I will be able to self-reference, needed for passing dependencies down, AND also supporting callbacks for lazy values. However, with classes you lose the ability to have synthesized initializers. However, this needs public visibility, so this loses that anyway.
// Having to reason about all these constraints is arguably something of a misfeature of Swift, but that could maybe be argued on the basis of optimization.
